	<h1>About</h1>
  
	<p>I am primarily interested in understanding how the human mind represents numbers and computes arithmetic operations. 
  I believe studying these questions will provide insights into how the brain encodes and manipulates information more generally, 
  as well as help to improve learning and instruction of mathematics. The aim of my PhD project has been to investigate how we 
  partition space when counting sets of objects. Specifically, I have used eye-tracking and psychophysics techniques to measure 
  how the spatial configuration of objects and task demands affect the ability to enumerate sets. I am keen to pursue this research 
  further to better characterise the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying enumeration. More broadly, I am interested in questions 
  related to measurement and developmental theory (computational modelling, classification), as well as integrating open-source 
  <a href="/mobile/touch/peripheral">blog</a> technologies into my research.</p>
