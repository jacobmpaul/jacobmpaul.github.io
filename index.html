	<p><i>"What is a <b>number</b> that a brain may know it, and a <b>brain</b> that it may know a number?"</i> adapted from McCulloch (1960).</p>
	
	<p><br>My name is Jacob, I'm a cognitive neuroscientist interested in how we interact with the quantitative world of numbers and mathematics. 
		A focus of my research is to better understand math learning disorders, such as dyscalculia, to help raise awareness and improve support for those who struggle with low numeracy everyday.</p>
	
	<p>I'm currently an academic research fellow in the <b><a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/426619-jacob-paul">School of Psychological Sciences</a></b> at the University of Melbourne, Australia.<p>
		
	<p>Previously I worked as a postdoc with <b><a href="https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/bmharvey">Prof Ben Harvey</a></b> in the Department of Experimental Psychology at Utrecht University, Netherlands.<p>
