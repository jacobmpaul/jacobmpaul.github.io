	<h1>About</h1>
  
	<p>I am primarily interested in understanding how the human brain represents numbers and computes arithmetic operations. 
		I believe studying these questions will provide more general insights into how information is encoded and manipulated 
		in neural circuits, and more specifically help to improve learning and instruction of mathematics. The aim of my PhD project 
		has been to investigate how we partition space when counting sets of objects. I have used eye-tracking and psychophysics 
		techniques to measure how the spatial configuration of objects and task demands affect peopleâ€™s ability to enumerate sets. 
		I am keen to pursue this research further to better characterise the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying enumeration. 
		More broadly, I am interested in questions related to measurement and developmental theory (computational modelling, 
		classification), as well as integrating open-source <a href="/blog">mobile/touch/peripheral</a> 
		technologies into my research.</p>
	
	<p>Outside the lab I enjoy running, working on hardware projects, and good humor.</p>
